	{Improvement on the Quaternion-based models: extension to larger datasets and Batch Normalization}
	{}
	\vspace{-8mm}
	\begin{justify}
		I am addressing the shortcomings of earlier research on the lottery ticket hypothesis for quaternion-based models as part of my term project for the CS460 ML Course. Even while earlier work had success with smaller models and datasets, it had difficulties with batch normalisation code that ran slowly and didn't test bigger datasets and models. In order to overcome these restrictions and develop the field of quaternion based models, I am concentrated on increasing the efficiency of Batch Normalization to enable trials with bigger data sets and models.

		At RTC, we are training an autonomous rover using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. We are starting with simulation environments like Carla and plan to implement the trained model on a 6-wheel rover equipped with sensors such as cameras and GPS for real-world deployment.
