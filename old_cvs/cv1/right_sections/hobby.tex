        During my time in the \textbf{RoboTech Club at NISER}, I gained extensive hands-on experience in \textbf{electronics}, \textbf{robotics}, and \textbf{embedded systems}. I learned to program microcontrollers (such as \textbf{Arduino}) and worked with \textbf{single-board computers} for building advanced robotic systems. I also developed 3D models for robotic components using \textbf{SolidWorks}.  
        
        As the lead of the \textbf{Rover Team}, I spearheaded the project to train a rover using \textbf{reinforcement learning} and the \textbf{NVIDIA Isaac Sim} platform from \textbf{Omniverse}. This training was aimed at enabling autonomous navigation in diverse environments. Additionally, I was part of the team that built an \textbf{autonomous drone} from scratch, using \textbf{Pixhawk 4} as the flight controller and incorporating manual and GPS-guided flight modes. The drone's construction involved \textbf{aluminium box pipes}, \textbf{switchboard sunmica plates}, and \textbf{3D-printed parts}, which was an invaluable learning experience in both hardware and software integration.
