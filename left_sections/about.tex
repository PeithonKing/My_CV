\cvsection{ABOUT ME}
	\begin{justify}
		\hspace{5mm}I am a \textbf{Physics Major} student (Int. MSc.) at the \href{https://www.niser.ac.in/}{\textbf{National Institute of Science Education and Research} (NISER)}.
		Apart from Physics, I have a keen interest in \textbf{Robotics and Technology}.
		I also love programming from the core of my heart.
		% I spend most of my leisure time keeping myself updated about various algorithms and frameworks.
		I am a \textbf{self-taught programmer} and have been learning new things on my own.
		These days I am finding myself more invloved in topics like \textbf{Machine Learning}, \textbf{Deep Learning} and \textbf{Image Processing}.
		As a member of the \href{https://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/club/rtc/}{\textbf{RoboTech Club (RTC)}} of NISER, I am trying to develop an autonomous rover using my \textbf{Reinforcement Learning} skills.
